### Installation

 | bash
`

Or:

1. Clone the repo and go to the Linux folder.

3. Start playing around with <b>reqy</b> now.

#### Windows

<b>Note:</b> You need to have Java and JDK installed in order to run this command.

### Usage

`reqy -U <url> -M <method> -F key1=value1 -F key2=value2
`

<b>Note:</b> When sending the URL, if it is the root or home path, i.e. if the URL is like http://example.com, entering this will not work as the command doesn't get any path. So, http:example.com/ should be passed instead of http://example.com (i.e. with an extra /).

#### Example

`reqy -U http://example.com -M GET`

`reqy -U http://localhost:3000/tryit -M POST -F username=test -F password=1234
`

<hr />

### Options

- <b>-U</b>: URL to hit
- <b>-M</b>: HTTP method (GET/POST)
- <b>-F</b>: Form data
- <b>-V</b>: Verbose mode, shows headers
- <b>-H</b>: List all options

### Why reqy?

Because sometimes, you just want a lightweight HTTP requester that wonâ€™t question your life choices. And if youâ€™re tired of manually crafting HTTP requests but still want to feel like a low-level hacker, reqyâ€™s got your back.

Plus, itâ€™s not like your other tools were going to send that request for you, right? ðŸ¤·
